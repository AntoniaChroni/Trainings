### Homebrew Cask

Homebrew Cask is a Homebrew extension for installing GUI software on Mac. 
Docker on Mac is a GUI tool, so you need to use Homebrew Cask for the installation.

It means that instead of the standard download and drag-and-drop process, you can use this:
```{}
brew install docker ‚Äìcask
```

üç∫ docker was successfully installed!

```{}
docker --version
```
